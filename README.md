# Big Nerd Ranch App \# 4 NerdLauncher

I'm going through the Big Nerd Ranch Book for Android Development, and keeping track of my progress in this repo.

This was a single chapter application, where we built a basic app launcher. There was one challenge to add the app icons so I just merged it into the master branch. This can act as your phones actual launcher, which is pretty cool :)
